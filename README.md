FinWise AI is an intelligent financial planning platform built for individuals, students, young professionals, and households. It combines deterministic personal finance math, an interactive ledger dashboard, and an orchestrated multi-agent AI assistant to deliver transparent, actionable financial insights.

Initially optimized for Indian users with Indian Rupee formatting (`₹`, `en-IN`), the application is architected for extensible multi-currency and global localization.

## 4. Quickstart Guide (Local Development)

You can run FinWise AI locally without installing MySQL; SQLite is enabled by default for rapid setup.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ and npm
- Python 3.11+

### Step 1: Clone & Setup Backend
```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows (PowerShell):
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start FastAPI server (runs on http://127.0.0.1:8000)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
Interactive OpenAPI documentation will be accessible at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

### Step 2: Start Frontend
In a separate terminal:
```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Next.js development server
npm run dev
```
Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Demo account
Use the **Try the demo account** button on `/login` (`demo@finwise.ai`).
There is no built-in admin password. To create an admin, set `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the backend environment.

### Email codes (sign-up and password reset)
Every account must confirm its email, and forgotten passwords are reset with a 6-digit code sent to the inbox.
- **Local development:** set `APP_ENV=development` in `backend/.env`. Codes are printed in the backend console, no email provider needed.
- **Production:** configure an email provider (`BREVO_API_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, or `SMTP_*`; see `backend/.env.example`). Without one, the API refuses to send codes instead of silently dropping them.

## 5. Docker Production Deployment

FinWise AI includes a multi-container Docker configuration with MySQL 8, the FastAPI backend, and Next.js frontend.

```bash
# Build and run all services in detached mode
docker-compose up -d --build

# Inspect running containers
docker-compose ps

# View backend logs
docker-compose logs -f backend
```

Services exposed:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:8000`
- MySQL Database: `localhost:3306`

## 6. Running Automated Tests

A comprehensive Pytest test suite verifies deterministic calculations, API authentication, transactions, and multi-agent coordination.

```bash
cd backend
# With virtual environment activated:
pytest -v
```

**Test Coverage Summary:**
- `tests/test_calculations.py`: Net cash flow, savings rate, budget usage, debt compounding, cash-flow forecasting simulation.
- `tests/test_api_auth_transactions.py`: JWT login, registration, transactions CRUD, duplicate detection.
- `tests/test_agents_and_planning.py`: Multi-agent orchestration, recommendation generation, approval lifecycle, and safety boundaries.

## 7. Multi-Agent AI Safeguards & Philosophy

1. **Deterministic Priority:** The AI never invents arithmetic. Cash-flow totals, debt amortization, and forecast balances are calculated strictly in pure Python.
2. **Read-Only Authorization:** AI agents can only read data explicitly owned by the authenticated session.
3. **Approval Before Mutation:** Recommendations generated by agents (e.g. adjusting a budget limit or increasing an emergency fund goal) enter a `pending` state and require manual user confirmation before updating records.
4. **Resilient Vendor Fallback:** If `GEMINI_API_KEY` is not provided, the platform automatically activates rule-based deterministic heuristics, guaranteeing zero downtime.
